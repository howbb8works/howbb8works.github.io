				<h2>Introducing <span class="bb8">BB-8</span></h2>
				<p>BB-8 is an astromech droid that appears on Star Wars Episode VII - The Force Awakens. It has a ball shaped body and a domed head that resembles that of the R2 series droids, whose most popular unit is <span class="bb8">R2-D2</span>. <span class="bb8">BB-8's</span> body rolls independently from the head, which always stays near the vertical axis of the droid.</p>

				<p>Like the R2 series, <span class="bb8">BB-8</span> also fits in the droid socket of an X-Wing starfighter. Specifically the T-70 x-Wing fighter model used by the Resistance thirty years after the Battle of Endor. BB-8 was first spotted on the desert planet of Jakku. Despite what most people think, several sources suggest that BB-8 is owned by <span class="spoiler-trigger">click to reveal spoiler</span><span class="spoiler">Resistance's pilot Poe Dameron</span>.</p>

				<h2>Concept</h2>
				<p>Director J.J. Abrams went old school during production of The Force Awakens. The original trilogy, which mainly used real sets and props, had a special vibe that was missing in the prequel trilogy. Abrams wanted Episode VII to feel organic and tactile, closer in spirit to the original movies. To achieve that, they used as many practical effects as possible, and <span class="bb8">BB-8</span> was no exception.</p>

				<p>The first known sketch of <span class="bb8">BB-8</span> was revealed during Star Wars Celebration 2015. It certainly wasn't a Ralph McQuarrie illustration, but the concept might be his. In an interview with Star Wars Insider, the artist responsible for the original trilogy concept art, said that he originally envisioned R2-D2 as a rolling droid. According to Episode VII producer Kathleen Kennedy, the film crew looked a lot at early concept art by McQuarrie during pre-production and some unused concepts have made it to The Force Awakens.</p>

				<p>The idea of a rolling robot was cool but complex. How do you bring alive a droid like that? CGI would have been the logical choice, but J.J. wanted a real prop. The Pinewood Studios' Creature Shop took on the challenge and eventually succeeded at building and puppeteering BB-8 in the film.</p>

				<h2>Technology</h2>
				<p>So, how does BB-8 work? What kind of black magic powers it? Well, what we know for sure is that it's not driven by a hamster as some theories suggest. The closest thing out there is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43tctP24Xmo" target="_blank">Sphero ball</a>, and turns out that Sphero was one of ten start-ups funded by Disney's first accelerator program in 2014. Disney CEO Bob Iger himself was Sphero's mentor inside the company. When he learnt about the filmmakers trying to build a rolling droid, he knew the right people for the job.</p>
				<p><span class="bb8">BB-8</span> and the Sphero are likely to share a very similar internal mechanism. As a matter of fact, some DIYers have alredy customized their Sphero balls to make them look like <span class="bb8">BB-8</span>. The RC robotic ball uses a gyroscope to determine which way is down and two wheels to move the sphere from inside. The base plate (batteries included) serves as a counterweight to keep the wheels acting against the lower half of the sphere. There's also a vertical bearing that helps to keep the wheels in contact with the walls.</p>
				<p>But what about the floating head? Because that's actually the jaw-dropping part. Here's where all the pieces come together. There is a patent by Disney's Imagineering R&amp;D group that sheds some light on the head mechanism. Surprisingly, the patent was filed in 2010, two years before Disney acquired Lucasfilm and four years before they invested in Sphero. Looks like they were into rolling droids before anyone suspected.</p>

				<h2>Patent</h2>
				<h3>Magnetic spherical balancing robot drive</h3>
				<h4><a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US8269447" target="_blank">US 8269447 B2</a></h4>
				<h4>Inventors:	Lanny Smoot , Dirk Ruiken</h4>
				<h4>Original Assignee:	Disney Enterprises, Inc.</h4>
				<h3>TL;DR</h3>
				<p>The first thing we have learnt from this patent is that there is a concept in robotics called holonomic motion. Ground-based holonomic robots are those who can instantaneously move in any direction on the horizontal plane. That makes them incredibly responsive. Both the Sphero and our little guy <span class="bb8">BB-8</span> are holonomic robots.</p>

				<p>The patent presents several variants of the invention, but one of them is suspiciously similar to <span class="bb8">BB-8</span>. According to this configuration, the body contains a drive system that always keeps a relative position with respect to the sphere. The system uses omni wheels to make the sphere roll in any direction. Each of those wheels is connected to a motor. The robot uses sensors (gyroscopes and accelerometers) to determine its position and dynamics. The drive system can be maneuvered using a remote controller. The base plate acts as a counterweight, keeping the center of gravity close to the ground. That keeps the wheels' traction on the inner shell of the body. So far pretty similar to the Sphero.</p>

				<p>The main difference we find with the Sphero is the dynamic mast described by the patent. There is also a control system that keeps everything in balance, making sure the mast is always in vertical position. This, if you think about it, makes the whole mechanism behave like a miniature Segway. The arm can rotate and, according to the patent, magnetically interact with an external element. That means <span class="bb8">BB-8's</span> head is most likely controlled via magnetic interaction. Magnets at the end of the mast and roller magnets at the base of the head.</p>

				<p>Now let's use some 3D to show how the inner mechanism of the cutest astromech in the galaxy might look like.</p>

		<div id="caption3d" class="caption3d">
			<p id="caption-mech1">This is our best guess based on how <span class="bb8">BB-8</span> behaves on screen. Instead of the vertical mast described on the patent, this mechanism uses a stool type set-up (based on the <span class="bb8">AT-AT</span> foot mechanics) which allows to freely move a magnet around the upper part of the sphere. We think that the drive system probably uses four omni wheels with ball bearings. Such configuration would allow to rotate the sphere in any direction. <span class="desktop-only">You can drag the model to see different angles of the mechanism.</span></p>

			<p id="caption-mech2">This solution represents the most spread theory on the internet. The first one to sketch it out was <a href="http://jalopnik.com/the-new-star-wars-droid-is-not-cgi-so-how-does-it-wor-1698461524##kxsegs=o7mp4e3md,o9i68fk9g,pexi6me2k" target="_blank">Jason Torchinsky</a>. It is the theory that better matches the information from the patent. The motorized arm has a spherical joint that allows it to flex in any direction. The head rotation motor is probably attached to the end of the mast. The head itself is probably very light and has magnetic rollers attached to the base. That would allow it to smoothly roll over the spheric body.</p>

				<h2>Update: Interview with Matt Denton, Electronic Design and Development Supervisor on The Force Awakens</h2>
				<p>Among the hundreds of emails we received to <a href="mailto:iknow@howbb8works.com">iknow@howbb8works.com</a> there was one particularly interesting. It came from Matthew Denton, one of the very few people who really knows. Matt is the Electronic Design and Development Supervisor for Neal Scanlan's Creature FX team. To put it simply, he designed BB-8's brain.<p>

				<p>Matt got in touch pointing out <a href="http://www.starwars.com/news/droid-dreams-how-neal-scanlan-and-the-star-wars-the-force-awakens-team-brought-bb-8-to-life" target="_blank">an interview that had just been released on starwars.com</a>. The article included some unexpected revelations about BB-8. We arranged an interview to shed further light on the topic and correct some mistaken conclusions our research had lead us to.<p>

				<p>The most surprising thing was learning that neither Sphero or the Disney Imagineering team had anything to do with the design and development of BB-8 despite their bonds with Lucasfilm.<p>

				<p class="quote">Our design wasn't based on the Sphero technology. If you look at the way the one on stage moves, you just couldn't do it. It behaves in a totally different way. And we weren't aware of the Disney Imagineering patent for the hovering head.<p>

				<p>The original Sphero ball wasn't even an inspiration for the Creature FX engineers.<p>

				<p class="quote">You can make a ball robot, but getting it to behave well and getting it to behave like the character is difficult. If you look at the Sphero it behaves the way it does; it can only behave one way. The way it's constructed, the head has to follow the ball.<p>

				<p>As a matter of fact, there was very little communication between both teams. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0107H5FJ6/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0107H5FJ6&linkCode=as2&tag=hobbwo-20&linkId=4JJA7NMIVCKK24WN" target="_blank">remote control BB-8 by Sphero</a> and the droid created by the Creature Shop are powered by different technologies. That makes perfect sense because each team was trying to solve a different challenge with different constraints. Matt thinks the technology they developed could be scaled down to create a toy version, but it would probably be too expensive to be commercialized.<p>

				<p>It was also quite surprising to find out that the only free-running version of BB-8 wasn't built until filming for Episode VII was nearing completion.<p>

				<p class="quote">We looked at all possibilities when we started design and development. We knew a fully functioning version was possible but it wouldn't have worked for most of the scenes so we went a different route.<p>

				<p>Many different versions of BB-8 were built for shooting, but the thought of creating a free-running version never left the minds of the Creature FX crew.<p>

				<p class="quote">We knew we could do it and at some point we said, we should do it before they ask us for it. So we started working on it in the background.<p>

				<p>The result was the droid we saw on stage during Star Wars Celebration. We asked Matt about the main challenges they faced when building the final version.<p>

				<p class="quote">Spinning on the spot was one of them. That idea came quite early on in the process. Joshua Lee, our senior animatronic designer, did most of the mechanical design but it was actually an idea I had. I didn't know if it would work or not, but Josh built it in. There were many engineering challenges inside of that thing but I would say the trickiest part was making it to behave like BB-8 should.<p>

				<p>Unfortunately Matt couldn't share any details about the internal mechanism. We still believe that if the Death Star plans were leaked, so will BB-8's plans. But don't bother looking for filed patents. As Matt puts it:<p>

				<p class="quote">There are things we probably could patent but we didn't. We don't tend to when the intention is creating something for film use only.<p>
